# Binary Christmas Tree
Welcome to the Holly Jolly Christmas Tree project!

Are you tired of boring, plain old Christmas trees? Look no further, because this project brings some extra cheer and joy to your holiday season with a festive, ASCII-art Christmas tree.

To use this project, simply run the `tree.ts` file and watch as a beautiful Christmas tree appears before your very eyes. You can even customize the tree by modifying the code to include your own special touches.

But beware, this tree may bring so much joy and cheer that you won't be able to stop singing Christmas carols all day long.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays from the Holly Jolly Christmas Tree project! 🎄🎅🎁
